# P-PY: Programming with Python

Resources and practical exercises for the Programming with Python (P-PY) course. This repo is a personal space for learning and experimenting with Python concepts, examples, and hands-on tasks.

## What’s inside
- `Prcticals-Q/`: practical question sets, exercises, and related material.
- Additional notes or resources may be added as the course progresses.

## Getting started
1) Install Python 3.10+.
2) Optionally create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate` (use `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows Command Prompt/PowerShell).
3) Add any required packages per exercise with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if such a file is added later).

## How to use this repo
- Work through practical questions in `Prcticals-Q/`, keeping your solutions organized by topic or date.
- Try small experiments to reinforce concepts (control flow, functions, OOP, file I/O, modules, testing).
- Commit regularly to track progress and learn from iterations.

## Notes
- This is a learning-focused repository; expect drafts, experiments, and incremental improvements.
